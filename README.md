### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jackie Lee.

I am a Web developer who recently graduated from a Full stack coding bootcamp at the University of Washington. My biggest strengths are in Javascript and backend development. I enjoy thinking about logic and problem solving algorithmic questions.  I'm currently seeking roles in software and web development in a collaborative enviroment with a lot of potential for growth.
